          Something of a cult legend in Ireland, Redbreast Single Pot Still
          Whiskey is quickly achieving the same elusive status in the U.S. To be
          a single pot still whiskey, malted barley is combined with un-malted

          citrus notes followed by dark caramel & more vanilla.
